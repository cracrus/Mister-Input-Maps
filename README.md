# Mister Input Maps
 Pre-configured input maps for MiSTer FPGA

 This is a collection of input mappings for common controllers.

 It enables use of controllers out of the box without mapping.

 If the default mapping is not to your liking, feel free to re-map the controller.

# Methodology
```
 Menu/OSD: Down + Select (Down + Start for Sega controllers)
 OK: Microsoft = A, Nintendo = A, Playstation = X
 Back: Microsoft = B, Nintendo = B, Playstation = O
```

# Limitations
 Several 8BitDo controllers share the same vendor ID and part ID (VID:PID = 045e:028e)

 These are named appropriately in the repository but may need to be renamed
